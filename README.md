This project contains supporting codes for the paper [Lagrange Multipliers and Rayleigh Quotient Iteration in Constrained Type Equations](https://github.com/dnguyend/lagrange_rayleigh/blob/master/docs/LagrangeRayleigh.pdf).

To run clone the project as a subfolder of some folder folder (say <parent>). You will see a folder <parent>/lagrange_rayleigh. Add <parent> to your PYTHONPATH and then run the codes in <parent>/lagrange_rayleigh/test/
Python 3 but should be mostly compatible with python 2.7 Require numpy and scipy

We show an example where the method here provide an improvement to the eigen-tensor problem by 30%:
