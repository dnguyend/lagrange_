This project contains supporting codes for the paper Lagrange Multipliers and Rayleigh Quotient Iteration in Constrained Type Equations.

To run clone the project as a subfolder of some folder folder (say <parent>). You will see a folder <parent>/lagrange_rayleigh. Add <parent> to your PYTHONPATH and then run the codes in <parent>/lagrange_rayleigh/test/
Code is python 2.7. Require numpy and scipy
